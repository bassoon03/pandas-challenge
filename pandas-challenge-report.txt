One observation that stands out is all the charter schools have higher average math scores than all the district schools. Furthermore,
all the charter schools have average math scores above the district average, while all the district schools have average math scores less
than the district average. The district average sits at 78.985%. The lowest average math score among the district schools and thus overall
is 76.629%, so just over 2 percentage points below the district average. All the charter schools have average math scores greater than 80% 
with the greatest sitting at 83.840%. Using only this metric it appears that students in charter schools are doing better in math than 
students in district schools.

A similar observation can be made for average reading scores. All the charter schools have average reading scores greater than the distric
average of 81.878% and all the district schools have average reading scores less than the district average. The lowest of the district
school average reading scores is 80.745%, while the highest of the charter school average reading scores is 84.045%. It appears that charter
schools outperform district school in both reading and math, at least on these two metrics.

The overall passing rates between the two types of schools is also drastically different. Out of all the charter schools, Holden High School
has the lowest overall passing rate at 89.227%, while the highest overall passing rate among the district schools is 54.642% at Bailey High
School. That is a difference of 24.585 percentage points.
